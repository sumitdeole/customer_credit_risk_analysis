### Credit Risk Modeling with Expert LLM Reporting
This project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for credit risk classification using three robust machine learning models:
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Deep Learning

The primary goal is to maximize recall, ensuring high-risk customers are not misclassified as low-risk. The workflow addresses class imbalance using SMOTE and provides automated, expert-level interpretation of results using a local LLM (Mistral via Ollama).
